    "This notebook proposes a general introduction to *goal babbling*, and how it differs from *motor babbling*, in the context of robotics. This notebook requires no previous knowledge beyond some elementary trigonometry and a basic grasp of the Python language. The spirit beyond this notebook is to show *all the code* of the algorithms, without relying any library beyond [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), and to do so in a simple way. Only the plotting routines, using the [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/) library, have been abstracted away in the [graphs.py](https://github.com/humm/recode/blob/master/benureau2015_gb/graphs.py) file.\n",

    "## A Bit of Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal babbling is a way for robots to discover their body and environment on their own. While those could be pre-programmed, there are many reasons not to do so: environments change, robotic bodies are becoming more complex, and flexible limbs, for instance, are difficult and expensive to control and simulate explicitly. Allowing robots to discover the world by themselves allows to use the world itself—the best physic engine we know—for robots to conduct their own experiments, and observing and learning the consequence of their actions, much like infants do on their way to becoming adults. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind goal babbling is to explore an unknown environment by deciding which goals to try to pursue in it, rather than deciding which action to try. For robots, it means directing the exploration by choosing which effects to produce in the environments, rather than choosing directly which motor commands to execute. Of course, once a goal has been chosen, the robot must find a motor command to reach it. But the decision on what to explore has been made on which effect to try to produce, not in the motor space, and we will see that it makes a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of goal babbling was proposed by [Oudeyer and Kaplan (2007)](#References) (p. 8). Computation implementations were then proposed by [Baranes and Oudeyer (2010)](#References); [Rolf et al. (2011)](#References) and [Jamone et al. (2011)](#References). Formal frameworks were described by [Baranes and Oudeyer (2013)](#References) and [Moulin-Frier and Oudeyer (2013)](#References); the work we present here can be understood as an implementation of SAGG-Random. The algorithms and results exposed here were originally presented in the chapter 0 and chapter 3 of [my Ph.D. thesis](http://fabien.benureau.com/docs/phd_benureau.pdf). They were implemented using the [explorers](https://github.com/humm/explorers) library then. Here, as explained above, we don't rely on the library, and the code has been exposed in its simplest form. It is entirely available under the [Open Science License](http://fabien.benureau.com/openscience.html)."

    "1. The (0, -1) point is not reachable by the arm, due to the angle constraints: that would require every joints to be at 180 degrees. The unreachable area inside the unit circle decreases with the number of joints; only in the 2-joint arm the area is significant. Additionally, in the 2-joint arm case, the area centered around the base of the arm is not reachable either, for the same reasons.\n",
    "3. We could add the orientation to the redundancy criterion. In that context, an arm is redundant only if it can produce the same position *and* orientation of the tip with different postures. Including the orientation criterion is important in most practical applications. Under that criterion, the 2-joint arm is not redundant."
