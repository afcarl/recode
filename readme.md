## Reimplementing Scientific Experiments

This repository contains reimplementations of experiments described in published scientific articles. Besides replicating published results—which is always good—, those implementations strive to be as short, as simple and as understandable as possible, without hiding the code behind layers of abstractions.

They are also coded in a way that allow to quickly try and experiment with differents values of the parameters to see how the algorithms react and when do they break.

Here are the list of available reimplementations:
- [Introduction to Goal Babbling](https://github.com/benureau/recode/tree/master/benureau2015_gb), *adapted from my Ph.D. Thesis, May 2015*
- [Extraordinary intelligence and the care of infants](https://github.com/benureau/recode/tree/master/piantadosi2016), *PNAS 2016*
- [Robots that can adapt like animals](https://github.com/benureau/recode/tree/master/cully2015), *Nature 2015*
